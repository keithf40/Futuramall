## 🧠 Project Concept

Malls were once the epicenter of shopping culture, but their popularity has declined with the rise of online shopping. However, online shopping lacks the immersive and social experience of visiting a mall. **Futuramall** bridges this gap by offering a virtual shopping environment that blends the convenience of e-commerce with the ambiance of a physical mall—reimagined in a serene outdoor setting.
